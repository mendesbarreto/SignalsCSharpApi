This library could be used in place of delegate and C# events.\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind this library is make you code clear and easy to add and remove \"listeners\" of a object event.\r\n\r\nBefore we start, I need you have some concepts in your mind such as:\r\n* Signal is a dispatcher of a single event in a specific object and hods a list of your own listeners.\r\n* Signal works like a delegate and Events, the difference in use signals are: You have less code to bore you. =)\r\n* The most common way to use this library is with user interface, but can be used to many ways especially in gaming applications.\r\n\r\nOk, Let's see some code!\r\n\r\nTODO: TUTORIAL coming soon!!!!\r\n\r\n#### How to Start\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n//Here the declaration\r\npublic Signal<int> OnTakeDamage = new Signal<int>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove is the declaration, very simple. The \"Signal\" is the class which we will use to bring the signal to life and the type between \"<>\" is what the signal will push to the listener. \r\n\"Obs: If you want nothing use Signal.Void class\".\r\n\r\n#### Adding Listeners\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n//Add a listener to our signal. \r\n//The OnHeroTakeDamageHandler is the listener, the function that will be called when the hero take some damage. \r\nOnTakeDamage.Add(OnHeroTakeDamageHandler);\r\n\r\n//OR\r\n\r\n// that handler only be called once.\r\nOnTakeDamage.AddOnce(OnHeroTakeDamageHandler);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor add listeners we have two forms, the first one is the method \"Add()\", when you use this method the system will register the listener in the Signal and will be called every time the Signal dispatch. The second one is the method \"AddOnce()\" it work in the same way that the \"Add()\" but the system call once, ie, will be removed automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Remove Listeners\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n//Remove a specific listener \r\nOnTakeDamage.Remove(OnHeroTakeDamageHandler);\r\n\r\n//OR\r\n\r\n//Remove All listeners\r\nOnTakeDamage.RemoveAll()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Dispatching\r\n```csharp\r\nOnTakeDamage.Dispatch(10);\r\n```\r\nTo dispatch the signal to the listeners is simple, use the \"Dispatch()\" method, and pass between \"()\" the value of type specified in the signal declaration, in this case \"int\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Signals?
